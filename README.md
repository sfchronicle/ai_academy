## Module 1: Introduction [⤴️](#table-of-contents)

### Goals

In this introductory module, we'll take a 30,000-foot view of the generative AI landscape, how we're approaching generative AI, what we'll be going over in future modules and more. No programming knowledge is required for this module.

### Topics

- What do I mean by "AI" and "Automation"?
- What's the value proposition of generative AI?
- What has the Central Devhub built so far?
- How have LLMs come to be? What are their limitations?
- Our guidelines for using generative AI?
- Course outlook.
- What are capstone projects?

### Homework

- **[Sign up for OpenAI account](https://openai.com/):** We're going to begin working with OpenAI's playground and API next week. When you sign up, you'll receive $5 in OpenAI bucks to use for when we're experimenting.
- **[Sign up for Github Copilot ✨on Monday✨](https://github.com/settings/copilot):** We're also going to touch on Github Copilot next week. *But don't sign up until the day before.* Copilot's free trial is time-based, and I want to maximize the amount of time you have it during this course.
- Post in the AI and Automation Academy Slack channel with what you're interested in learning in the context of the next module — so anything to do with prompting, OpenAI, Github Copilot and the like.
- Post one interesting use of *generative* (not predictive) AI in the wild in the course's Slack channel. It doesn't have to be from a media outlet. It doesn't have to be something good. It could be something that went terribly wrong.

### Readings

- **[Beginner’s prompt handbook: ChatGPT for local news publishers | Joe Amditis x Center for Cooperative Media](https://jamditis.notion.site/jamditis/Beginner-s-prompt-handbook-ChatGPT-for-local-news-publishers-15d1f07d5b194265a41fdd42955679b4):** Skim this. You don't need to read all of it. You might even get by with just reading the headers. I just don't want y'all to come in completely cold next week. We'll be covering much of what's here.
- **[AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects | Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/):** I just want you to read the intro. It echoes how I feel when I'm using generative AI to accomplish a task I've never done before.
- **[What OpenAI Really Wants | Steven Levy x WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/what-openai-really-wants/):** This is totally optional because I know not everyone wants to read a 9,400-word profile, but I'm telling y'all, it's an excellent encapsulation of OpenAI's history and what they've become.
- **[Generative AI: What journalists need to know about ChatGPT and other tools | Knight Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3TVqJ88Wew):** This is also optional because I know not everyone wants to watch/listen to an hour-long conversation about generative AI.

### Extras

Where does Ryan go to stay up to date with the rapidly evolving world of  generative AI? Here's a list of information sources in no particular order:

- **[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/artificial-intelligence):** My favorite writers that cover AI at the NYT are [Cade Metz](https://www.nytimes.com/by/cade-metz) and [Kevin Roose](https://www.nytimes.com/by/kevin-roose). Roose also co-hosts the Times' [Hard Fork podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/podcasts/hard-fork-burning-man-musk-adl.html) with Platformer's Casey Newton where they frequently discuss generative AI topics.
- **[WIRED magazine](https://www.wired.com/search/?q=AI&sort=score+desc):** WIRED also does a top notch job at covering the big ideas that are swirling this subject. [Steven Levy](https://www.wired.com/author/steven-levy/) is my favorite writer there.
- **[OpenAI's Blog](https://openai.com/blog):** It's good to hear what's new from OpenAI straight from the horse's mouth.
- **[Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/):** Simon's blog is way more technical than other sources. I admire the ambitious projects he takes on using LLMs and adjacent technologies. It feels like he's always pushing the envelope.
- **[Newsroom Robots | Nikita Roy](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newsroom-robots/id1681331324)**: A podcast? About AI use inside of newsrooms around the world? What else could you ask for!
- **[One Useful Thing | Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/):** A lovely newsletter by Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. His thinking has had an impact on my thinking.
- **[AI Snake Oil | Arvind Narayanan, Sayash Kapoor](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/):** There's a ton of hype around AI — specifically generative AI — these days. Arvind and Sayash aim to "dispel hype, remove misconceptions, and clarify the limits of AI." It's vital to be realistic with what these technologies are capable of.
- **[Hacker News](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastMonth&page=0&prefix=false&query=GPT&sort=byPopularity&type=story):** Hacker news encompasses *a lot*, so you'll have to hunt out links relevant to generative AI. But when you do, the ideas and discussions are incredibly valuable.
- **[Emergent Mind](https://www.emergentmind.com/):** This link aggregator is all about AI.
- **Reddit:** Specifically [/r/openai](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/) and [/r/chatgpt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/).
- **[OpenAI Discord](https://discord.com/servers/openai-974519864045756446):** I prefer the structured nature of Reddit's threads, but you can find valuable discussion and inspiration on OpenAI's official Discord.

✨*Quick aside*:✨ You might see this list and think "Ryan, there are too many sources to keep up with! I'm not going to check every site every damn day". Let me us this opportunity to recommend using an [RSS reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator). RSS is often forgotten about, but not by me. It's an insanely powerful tool in processing a deluge of news. With the exception of OpenAI's Discord, all of the listed information sources can be loaded into an RSS reader. I personally use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/), but a solid free option is [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).

OK, back to business.

Hearst has [it's own set of policies regarding generative AI](https://www.expressnews.com/ai_use/), but I think it's useful to see how other media outlets are handling the technology:

- **[Standards around generative AI | The Associated Press](https://blog.ap.org/standards-around-generative-ai)**: I'm a huge fan of the following line when it comes to communicating with your peers about the outputs of generative AI: "Any output from a generative AI tool should be treated as unvetted source material. AP staff must apply their editorial judgment and AP’s sourcing standards when considering any information for publication."
- **[Data and AI ethics principles | Reuters:](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/artificial-intelligence/ai-principles.html)**
- **[The Guardian’s approach to generative AI | The Guardian:](https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2023/jun/16/the-guardians-approach-to-generative-ai)**

### Why, Ryan?

Each module I'm going try to share with you a quirky, weird, off-the-wall link to something that uses or touches on generative AI — just to keep things fun. This week, I direct your attention to [pepperoni hug spot](https://www.pepperonihugspot.pizza/pepperonihugspot) from [Pizza Later](https://www.pepperonihugspot.pizza/).
